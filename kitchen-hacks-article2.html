Who Needs Knives When You Have Floss?

If you forgot a knife for your picnic and don't know how to cut a watermelon, don't worry. Just take a thread or even better, a dental floss, and cut the pulp from the down side first and later divide it into several equal slices, as many as you need.
<br>
<br>
Next time you bring a watermelon wedge to a picnic or cookout, skip bringing the knife because all you need is dental floss. 
<br>
<br>
The trick here is you're actually gonna use the dental floss to cut the watermelon into pieces. It sounds crazy, but it really works, I promise. 
<br>
<br>
Start with a large piece of dental floss and just twist it around. Your two pointer fingers and you're going to start on one end of the watermelon. And you're going to actually cut down through the bottom of the fruit. And just kind of use your hands to hold the watermelon in place as you go. And then just use the dental floss to cut the watermelon into wedges just like this. 
<br>
<br>
Then you can separate the watermelon in pieces for easy grabbing but the best part is that your watermelon ring doubles as a platter and this ladies and gentlemans is a mad genius tip.
