The Easiest Contour Using a Fork

Since everyone has perfectly symmetrical features, using a fork to contour your nose couldn't possibly look lopsided or weird! Spend even more time with your trusty fork by washing it everyday because it will be crusty after every use.
<br>
<br>
After excitedly trying to contour my own face – and failing miserably – I put the contour sticks into my nearly barren makeup bag and forgot about them until the fateful day when I heard about someone contouring their face with a spoon. Something hit me, and I knew I had to bring out my contour sticks. I would not only try using a spoon to contour my face, but I wanted to use the whole cutlery family, fork and knife included.
<br>
<br>
I started out using the knife to make a line from the outside of my eye to the tip of my nose.
<br>
<br>
I applied the highlighter in the middle of my forehead, chin and nose according to the usual contouring rules. When I got to the nose part, I used the knife again to assist in making a straight line down my nose.
<br>
<br>
When I got to the contour stick, I switched to my spoon. I put the spoon on my cheek bone and traced the contour stick below it.
<br>
<br>
I also used the spoon to contour the top and bottom of my face.
<br>
<br>
It was really tough trying to find a function for the fork, but I finally decided on using it for contouring my nose. I ran the contour stick through the hole between two of the forks prongs. It actually worked really well and I got a fairly straight line on both sides.
