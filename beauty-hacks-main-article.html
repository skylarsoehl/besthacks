How to Look Cool with that Aluminum Foil Bling

The other day I was in the doctor’s office and the receptionist had on a chunky silver link necklace. It was super snazzy but for a second I thought it was made out of tin foil. Then I thought, that would be a nice craft idea. Do you ever get ideas this way? So I tried it and it came out great!

All you need is aluminum foil and double stick tape. Here’s how I made mine… Using a straight edge I peeled the foil into squares (sizes and quantities: five 5 X 5 inch, two 4.75 X 4.75, two 4.5 X 4.5, and so on until about 2.5 inches). Mine came out a little short so you might want to increase the quantities so it turns out longer. Next I rolled each piece around a pencil, removed the pencil and flatted the roll. I also precut a bunch of pieces of double sticky tape. Then I constructed the necklace by connected loops in descending size.

Could be a nice handmade holiday gift idea instead of getting something from a real store that would probably take less time!
