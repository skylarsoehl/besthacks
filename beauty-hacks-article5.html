Why Wear Pantyhose When You Could Fake It?

Your newest pair of pantyhose= body lotion + concealer!!!! Don't bother with buying pantyhose when you could wear body lotion and concealer on your legs that will definitely rub off on everything you touch.
<br>
<br>
Summer is almost here — and that means it's time to throw your black tights in the trash, set the trash on fire, and break out ALL your shorts, skirts, and dresses.
<br>
<br>
That's right, friends: sun's out, legs out. And for many people, adding a touch of leg makeup helps them feel their summer best.
<br>
<br>
But which leg makeup is the best for summer? Which product will give me the glossy, perfected legs of a Malibu Barbie?
<br>
<br>
There was only one way to find out. I tested five different leg makeup products, ranging in price from $12 to $52, to find out which one(s) would give me the Barbie legs of my summer dreams.
<br>
<br>
They're also pale, patchworked with childhood scars, and often pretty bruised up — the latter is thanks to my small but enthusiastic dog who shows his love by jumping all over me.
<br>
<br>
I also have keratosis pilaris, a skin condition sometimes called "strawberry legs," characterized by lumpy bumps on my arms and legs (and occasionally my neck). Though my KP is quite mild, it tends to get quite red and sore by my knees.
<br>
<br>
I don't see any of these things as "flaws," btw. It's just how my legs are.
<br>
<br>
Now you never have to use pantyhose again, just take 30 minutes to dress your legs up with makeup in addition to your face in the morning, this is really a true lifehack.
