Read all about a simply genius and incredibly easy way to open metal cans. Can openers are overrated. Bend all of the spoons in your house by using them to pry open cans like a man!
<br>
<br>
Are you stuck without a can opener? No problem: can lids are made with a thin piece of metal that isn't difficult to break through. You can use a spoon, a chef's knife, a pocket knife or a rock to break through the lid without contaminating the food inside. After just a few minutes of effort you'll be able to access the tasty contents of your can.
<br>
<br>
Place the can on a stable surface. Use one hand to hold it firmly in place while you work the spoon with your other hand.[2]
<br>
<br>
Position the tip of a spoon against the inner edge of the lid. The lid of the can will have a small, raised lip that has been crimped to seal the can closed. You want to position the spoon in a spot along the inside of this lip.
Hold the spoon so that the inside of its bowl is facing the lid of the can.
You need a metal spoon for this method. Any other material won't work.
<br>
<br>
Rub the tip of the spoon back and forth. Work it over the same small area right where the edge of the lid is crimped. The friction from rubbing the spoon back and forth will begin to thin the can lid. Keep going until you have rubbed through the lid.
<br>
<br>
Scoot the spoon over and keep rubbing. Rub the spot next to the first area you rubbed. Keep going until you have rubbed through the lid. The hole you have made in the lid is now slightly bigger.
<br>
<br>
Continue around the edge of the lid. Keep scooting the spoon over and rubbing through the lid until you have circled the entire can lid. The lid should now be loose. Don't tip it upside down, or your food will spill out.
<br>
<br>
Pry open the lid. Dig the spoon under the edge of the lid. Pry the lid upward until it pops out of place. Carefully lift it away to reveal the food inside.
If you find it difficult to pry off the lid with the spoon, try using a knife instead. You can use the knife to saw through any small parts of the lid that remain connected to the can.
The lid will be sharp, so be careful not to cut your finger on its edge when you pry it off. Use your sleeve or a towel to protect yourself if necessary.
