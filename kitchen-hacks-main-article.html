Coring an apple can be difficult. If you don't have an apple corer, you can use a knife, however, you might end up cutting out part of the apple which is a waste. You can core an apple with a syringe similar to the way that you would hull a strawberry. 
<br>
<br>
Using a heated knife, but the top of the syringe off. This will allow you to get the core out of the apple. Next, push the syringe over the stem and into the core. It might take a bit of strength. 
<br>
<br>
After you have pushed the syringe completely through the apple, pull it out and push on the plunger. This will push the core out of the syringe so that you can use it again.
