Read all about a simply genius and incredibly easy way to get plumper, fuller lips. Just use a glass you already have at home and breathe in until you pass out!
<br>
<br>
Bee-stung, plumped lips are sexy and youthful. It doesn't take a scientific study or a poll to figure out that full lips are more attractive than thin, flat ones. There’s a reason Angelina Jolie is famous. Sure she's beautiful, talented, generous, kind-hearted, and married to Brad Pitt. But let’s be real, her lips are what make her legendary!
<br>
<br>
If you have thin lips like I do, you’ve probably tried every trick in the book to make them look bigger. You’ve used light-colored lipsticks, artfully applied lip liner and a dot of gloss just on the center of the lower lip to give the illusion of fullness, or maybe you’ve used a subdued, almost-invisible nude lip and concentrated your makeup and enhancement efforts on your eyes and skin.
<br>
<br>
But the fact remains that thin lips are unattractive. They make you look older and constantly maintaining lipstick, liner, and gloss gets ridiculous. What’s a girl to do?
<br>
<br>
Fortunately, I also found a cost-free way to plump up those lips. You can make them as plump as you like, or even get them too plump if you're not careful. Plus it works on everyone. I’ve personally used this method to increase the size of my lips.
<br>
<br>
At first, the effects lasted only a few hours, which was fine, but after about six months of regularly using this method, it seems that my lips have gotten plumper permanently. And when I want or need to, I can spend a couple seconds on this method and plump my lips. It's faster than putting on lipstick and it costs NOTHING. Zero. Zilch. Nada.
<br>
<br>
Win!
