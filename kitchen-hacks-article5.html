You know you want your watermelon slices to have sticks in them. It only takes 5 times as long as the old outdated way of cutting then sticking!
<br>
<br>
Watermelon on a stick, isn’t that the coolest idea? No cooking required for this one! Sometimes it’s the simplest things that make the best desserts.
<br>
<br>
Take sweet watermelon for example, the perfect summer dessert as is – but add a stick to it and you have a fun way to present it at your backyard parties. I saw this on Real Simple and I knew I wanted to share this idea with you all. My husband thought it was brilliant as we happily enjoyed this after dinner.

Note: not a recipe, simply a fun idea I thought I would share to add another step to your watermelon eating. No cooking required.
