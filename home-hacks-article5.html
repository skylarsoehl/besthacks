You know you want your 1 oz bags of stale granola to be preserved forever so it can sit on a shelf and grow mold. Don't use a regular plastic bag. Use aluminum foil and iron it for 1 hour to preserve your precious granola!
<br>
<br>
With your hand, hold the bag closed by the top.
<br>
<br>
Insert the vacuum cleaner (I removed all the tube attachments to make it easier to insert) and turn it on until the bag stops shrinking.
<br>
<br>
...And bask in the glory of all the space you saved in your cabinet! Just make sure the bag has no holes and the knot leaves the bag completely sealed.
<br>
<br>
Then, wrap it up in aluminum foil to preserve its goodness and iron it for an hour to keep it good and fresh forever.
<br>
<br>
When the time comes to restore all your stuff to its air-filled glory, just rip the foil, open the bag and watch your granola spring back to life!
