Curl Your Hair Like Never Before

Forget curling irons and hot rollers when you could just use plastic forks to achieve those perfect ringlets! They're comfy to sleep in, too. It will only take 12-24 hours for you to achieve a very uneven and mildly crimped effect.

It may have been Ariel in the movie The Little Mermaid (remember when she finds a fork and names it a dingle hopper and proceeds to use it as a makeshift brush and styling tool?) that was the inspiration for this beauty tutorial that has gone viral, or maybe it was simply the creative imagination of thebeautyelite, but either way you slice it, itâ€™s pretty amazing that she was able to use a pack of 24 disposable plastic forks to curl her hair.

In this totally mesmerizing video, she first uses one of the forks to gently and quickly "comb" out her hair before applying a styling product to her dry hair, concentrating heavily on the ends. Taking small sections of hair, she wraps the hair (from the bottom up) around the handle of the fork and twists and turns the fork in such a way to get it to stay in place. Then, she sets her hair with a blowdryer and keeps the forks in place for about 10 minutes.
