When you were a kid, do you remember making little figurines out of whatever you could find around the house? These smallarts-and-crafts projects brought us many hours of joy. At Forked Up Art, we’ve taken that bit of artistic nostalgia and knocked it up a notch with our Spoon Man Salt and Pepper Shakers Holder. Place our little guy anywhere in your kitchen to add a bit of creativity into your life. Place him on your dining room table as a conversation piece and for easy access to the salt and pepper. Place him by the stove as your little cooking helper and fill his glass mills with whatever seasoning you desire! We believe in creativity and have a passion for creating household accessories out of everyday things. This passion is at the heart of everything we do, and we are confident that it shows in the quality and look of our products. It is our goal to have one of our little sculptures in the kitchen of every home in the USA!  During the recession in 2010, founder Judson Jennings suddenly found himself without steady work and he struggled to pay bills for school. While living with his in-laws, Judson, with his unstoppable passion for creativity, took a bag of flatware that his mother-in-law was about to throw out and created his first figurine. Forked Up Art now sells to over 1000 retailers nationwide and is dedicated to being the "Fork Authority of the World." Forked Up Art is now creating pieces for the yard as well as for tables, lamps, and chandeliers.  Forked Up Art is even creating jewelry made out of forks and spoons. "If it's done with forks and spoons, we want to be the ones doing it.”
