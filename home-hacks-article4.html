Try the new and improved method of pouring antibacterial hand sanitizer directly on your small cut. It might sting a lot because there is alcohol in it, but using Sanitelle sure beats running your finger under water and putting on a regular bandaid.
<br>
<br>
Hand Sanitizer ... in small amounts will not harm an open cut. Dousing your cut with some sani is the perfect way to feel a small burn but also skip the bandaid. Even though itâ€™s suggested to wash cuts with water, you might not always have that around.
<br>
<br>
Because many people carry sanitizer on their person, this is a perfect hack for cuts on the go. Try it out, it will only hurt a little!
